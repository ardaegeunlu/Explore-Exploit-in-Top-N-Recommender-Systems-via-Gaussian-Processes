# Explore-Exploit-in-Top-N-Recommender-Systems-via-Gaussian-Processes

A simple MATLAB Implementation of CGP-RANK algorithm [1]. CGP-RANK ranks an ordered list of recommendations, and it is a well suited algorithm for web-scale tasks, where the number of items available for recommendation is too large, and the context space too complex, compared to the relatively sparse click feedback.

CGP-RANK is an upper-confidence style algorithm, which exploits prior information specified in terms of a Gaussian process kernel function, which allows to share feedback in three ways: between positions in a list, between items, and between contexts [2]. Choice of kernels expresses our prior assumption of how smoothly the rewards change over the item-context space, and allows us to predict the performance of yet unexplored lists using Gaussian Process models.

## Dependencies

You need to have the following libraries.
```
GPML Matlab Code version 4.2
```

## How to Run

### Define your Input Space
```python
# create arrays of actions and contexts
actions = np.arange(-3, 3.25, 0.25)
contexts = np.arange(-3, 3.25, 0.25)
```
